        This Leave Management System is a demonstration application built for educational and portfolio purposes. It showcases functionalities such as user registration, login, role-based authorization, and leave request handling, developed using ASP.NET Core MVC.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Data Usage:</strong> The application may simulate the use of user data including email addresses, names and leave records. However, no real user data is collected, stored, or shared outside of your local environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Email Verification:</strong> During registration, email confirmation is implemented using a development email tool (e.g., Papercut SMTP). Emails are never sent to real email servers. This feature is purely for demonstration.
